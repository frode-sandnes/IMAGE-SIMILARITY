# Experimentation
You will find the relevant part in my [Source code notes](/imageSimilarity.js). Note that these are notes and not source code ready to be used out of the box. The code has not been cleaned.

You can run the experiments from the browser using this [html document](/imageSimilarity.html).

To use this cood you need the SSIM.js library:
https://obartra.github.io/ssim/

And the sdbscan.js library:
(https://github.com/solzimer/sdbscan/

For some of the experiments you may also need tensorflow.js.
